# Elon-Musk-s-Tweets-Sentiment-Analysis


## Situation
While searching for a dataset to practice new techniques, I came across the "Elon Musk's Tweets Dataset 2022" on Kaggle. This dataset caught my attention as it provided an opportunity to analyze and gain insights from Elon Musk's tweets.

## Task
The goal of this project is to analyze Elon Musk's tweets from 2022 and answer several key questions related to tweet sentiment, tweet frequency, and the correlation between tweet sentiment and likes/retweets. By performing this analysis, I aim to enhance my skills in data analysis and utilize various Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn.

## Action
To achieve the objectives of this project, the following actions were taken:

- Downloaded the "Elon Musk's Tweets Dataset 2022" from Kaggle, which includes information about the total number of tweets, retweets, and likes, as well as the sentiment and subjectivity of each tweet.
  
- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas to ensure data quality and consistency.

- Employed sentiment analysis techniques, including the utilization of the textblob package, to determine the sentiment of each tweet and categorize them as positive, negative, or neutral.

- Analyzed the tweet frequency across different months of the year to identify patterns and trends.

- Investigated the correlation between tweet sentiment and the number of likes and retweets received by utilizing visualization tools such as Seaborn.

- Explored the distribution of tweet activity across different days of the week to understand Elon Musk's tweeting habits.

## Results
The analysis of Elon Musk's tweets from 2022 yielded the following results:

- Positive sentiment tweets were the most common, with negative sentiment tweets accounting for only around 14% of the total.

- There was a positive correlation between tweet sentiment and the number of likes and retweets received.

- Positive sentiment tweets were predominantly objective and fact-based, with fewer opinion-based tweets.
